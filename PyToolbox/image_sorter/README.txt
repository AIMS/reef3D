This script will walk you through three steps to: 
    1) Sort images: This step organises all the images from the Left (LC) and Right (RC) cameras, in a given Reef folder, into subfolders using a time gap to distinguish transects and sites. 
    Then, it automatically recognises the QR codes in the images and rename transect subfolders for each camera folder. 
    2) Manually review subfolder names and allocate names to those where QR was not recognised 
    3) Automatically merge subfolders from Left and Right Camera

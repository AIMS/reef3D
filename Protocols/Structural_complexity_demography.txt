#### EXPORT POINTS AND CAMERA LOCATION FROM METASHAPE
1. Make sure the model is orientated correctly (looking from the top). To do this use the "Rotate object tool" from the menu Model/Transform Object. 
2. Make sure the model is scaled. You will the scale bars in the Referece Pane and each scale bar will have an error. If not, press refresh bottom from the top of the pane (circular arrows).
3. If not scaled, run the following script: "Z:\scripts\reef3D\PyToolbox\5-add_mksscalebars.py"
4. Rename chunk with the following naming convention: [REEF NAME]_[DATE]_[SITE]_[REPEAT]. For example:
	JOHN BREWER REEF_160719_S1T1_R1 
5.Run Batch Script: MS_export_batch.
6. For each step in the script make sure the path is right. For example:
	Cameras: Z:/exports/cameras/Demographics/{chunklabel}.txt
	Points: Z:/exports/pointsXYZ/Demographics/{chunklabel}.txt
7. From the popup window, you can press Background to keep working on other projects.

NOTE: Z:= PEARL/3d_ltmp.
NOTE2: Run this locallly.




### CALCULATE STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY FROM 3D MODELS USING AIMS HPC 

1. Launch HPC interactive: https://hpc-interactive.aims.gov.au:3443/
2. Launch GNOME session
3. Open Terminal 
4. Load Matlab module: 
	module load MATLAB/R2018a
5. Change directory to script folder:
	cd /export/home/l-p/mgonzale/Desktop/gits/reef3D/data_analyses
6. Run function to calaculte Structural complexity:
	matlab -nodisplay -nodesktop -nosplash -r "summary_transect_demogr 
	[PATH_TO_POINTS] [PATH_TO_CAMERAS] [PATH_TO_SCRIPTS] [PATH_TO_EXPORT_FOLDER]" 
	
	WHERE:
	[PATH_TO_POINTS] is the directory path to the point clouds folder for the specific campaign
		(e.g., '/net/138.7.48.21/3d_ltmp/exports/pointsXYZ/RM/201819/OR/')
	
	[PATH_TO_CAMERAS] is the directory path containing the camera pose for the specific campaign
		(e.g., '/net/138.7.48.21/3d_ltmp/exports/cameras/RM/201819/OR/')
	
	[PATH_TO_SCRIPTS] is the directory path where the scripts are contained
		(e.g., '/export/home/l-p/mgonzale/Desktop/gits/reef3D/')
	
	[PATH_TO_EXPORT_FOLDER] is the folder where to export the results. 
		(e.g., '/net/138.7.48.21/3d_ltmp/exports')

Example:
matlab -nodisplay -nodesktop -nosplash -r "summary_transect '/net/138.7.48.21/3d_ltmp/exports/pointsXYZ/RM/201819/OR/'  '/net/138.7.48.21/3d_ltmp/exports/cameras/RM/201819/OR/' '/export/home/l-p/mgonzale/Desktop/gits/reef3D/'  '/net/138.7.48.21/3d_ltmp/exports'"

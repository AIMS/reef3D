### CALCULATE STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY FROM 3D MODELS USING AIMS HPC 

1. Launch HPC interactive: https://hpc-interactive.aims.gov.au:3443/
2. Launch GNOME session
3. Open Terminal 
4. Load Matlab module: 
	module load MATLAB/R2018a
5. Change directory to script folder:
	cd /export/home/l-p/mgonzale/Desktop/gits/reef3D/data_analyses
6. Run function to calaculte Structural complexity:
	matlab -nodisplay -nodesktop -nosplash -r "summary_transect 
	[PATH_TO_POINTS] [PATH_TO_CAMERAS] [PATH_TO_SCRIPTS] [PATH_TO_EXPORT_FOLDER]" 
	
	WHERE:
	[PATH_TO_POINTS] is the directory path to the point clouds folder for the specific campaign
		(e.g., '/net/138.7.48.21/3d_ltmp/exports/pointsXYZ/RM/201819/OR/')
	
	[PATH_TO_CAMERAS] is the directory path containing the camera pose for the specific campaign
		(e.g., '/net/138.7.48.21/3d_ltmp/exports/cameras/RM/201819/OR/')
	
	[PATH_TO_SCRIPTS] is the directory path where the scripts are contained
		(e.g., '/export/home/l-p/mgonzale/Desktop/gits/reef3D/')
	
	[PATH_TO_EXPORT_FOLDER] is the folder where to export the results. 
		(e.g., '/net/138.7.48.21/3d_ltmp/exports')

Example:
matlab -nodisplay -nodesktop -nosplash -r "summary_transect '/net/138.7.48.21/3d_ltmp/exports/pointsXYZ/RM/201819/OR/'  '/net/138.7.48.21/3d_ltmp/exports/cameras/RM/201819/OR/' '/export/home/l-p/mgonzale/Desktop/gits/reef3D/'  '/net/138.7.48.21/3d_ltmp/exports'"
